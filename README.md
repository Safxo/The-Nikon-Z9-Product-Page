# The-Nikon-Z9-Product-Page
This is a mock up product page for the Nikon Z9 Mirrorless Camera! 

You may wonder why? Why would I pick such a specific product page that goes beyond the company and all of its products, to highlight a specific camera and specific trim? 

It's simple. I decided to create a product page for the Nikon Z9 because of a couple reasons. 
  Firstly, the brand and Z line. To me it's home. To me it's my go to. Aside from computer science, and front-end dev. , I do professional photography, and have been doing it for about 10 years - raking in clients at the age 10 (building a client base and gaining skills at such a young age made me business minded earlier than most). I have been using the Nikon Z7 for years and absolutely love it. To me it is the perfect camera, and allows me to create stunning, moving, captivating pieces of art through high res photos and videos. 
  Secondly. The Nikon Z9 is my dream camera. With it being at the top of the Nikon Z line food chain, it comes at a steep price, however it is something I'll always admire and have my eyes on, with hopes to have one in my possession sometime. 

Now onto the project itself! This is my first product page and uses many techniques that I find useful and will be implementing throughout my career. This product page consists of one page, includes very appealing and inmportant information without overwhelming the audience. On top of this, I made the decision to add a demo from YouTube to show off just how strong the performance is on the Nikon Z9. It shows video footage captured on the Nikon Z9. Which upon seeing for myself, even blew me away.

This project will be the first of many product/ecommerce projects I will be working on. With critical information being learned throughout this project, this project will have a special place in my heart since it is a stepping stone that will propel me towards being a highly knowledgeable, and experienced dev :) 

As with any other project, I hope this was a pleasant experience!
